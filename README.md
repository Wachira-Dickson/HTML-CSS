HTML & CSS 

Introduction
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are essential technologies for building web pages. 
HTML provides the structure, while CSS enhances the visual presentation. Together, they create responsive, accessible, and visually appealing websites.

HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML is the backbone of web pages. It defines the structure and content using elements such as:

<head>: Contains metadata, links to stylesheets, and scripts.
<body>: Holds visible content like text, images, and forms.
<div> & <section>: Used for layout and organization.
<a>: Creates hyperlinks.
<img>: Displays images.
<form>: Collects user input.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is used to style HTML elements, control layout, and improve user experience.

Selectors: Target elements (p { color: blue; }).
Properties: Define styling rules (background-color, font-size).
Layouts: Utilize flexbox and grid for responsive design.
Media Queries: Adapt styles based on screen size.

Conclusion
HTML provides structure, and CSS enhances appearance. Together, they form the foundation of modern web development.
